# Golden-Age-of-video-Games
In this project, we have analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. We searched for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.
